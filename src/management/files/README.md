#### Files sequence

If you wish to use the command **populateTransactions**, you need to add all the provided xlsx files from B3, but you must ensure they are in the correct order.

The command will read transactions in order from the oldest to the newest record, hence the importance of keeping the files organized.

Later on, it will be possible to manually add transactions as they become available from B3.
